				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">Is there a need to practice the organic farming?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content"  >
					<p style="color:black;">With the increase in population our compulsion would be not only to stabilize agricultural production but also to increase it further in sustainable manner. Excessive use over years of agro-chemicals like pesticides and fertilizers may affect the soil health and lead to declining of crop yields and quality of products. Hence, a natural balance needs to be maintained at all cost for existence of life and property. The obvious choice would be judicious use of agro-chemicals and more and more use of naturally occurring material in farming systems. </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">What are the benefits of organic farming?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>
    It helps in maintaining environment health by reducing the level of pollution <br>
    It reduces human and animal health hazards by reducing the level of residues in the product.<br>
    It helps in keeping agricultural production at a higher level and makes it sustainable.<br>
    It reduces the cost of agricultural production and also improves the soil health.<br>
    It ensures optimum utilization of natural resources for short-term benefit and helps in conserving them for future generation.<br>
    It not only saves energy for both animal and machine, but also reduces risk of crop failure.<br>
    It improves the soil physical properties such as granulation, and good tilth, good aeration, easy root penetration and improves water-holding capacity.<br>
    It improves the soilâ€™s chemical properties such as supply and retention of soil nutrients, and promotes favorable chemical reactions.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">How are insect pests managed on organic farms?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p style="color:black;">Organic farm systems protect crop damage by insect pests primarily through the use of biological and cultural practices such as crop rotation; diversification; habitat management; beneficial organism releases; sanitation; and timing.  Some natural substances, such as botanicals, and a few relatively non-toxic synthetic pesticides such as soap are permitted by the USDA National Organic Program Standards when used in conjunction with the farm plan and used according to the restrictions found on the National List.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">What is the difference between carbon on soil and carbon in soil?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p style="color:black;">SOC is the carbon component of organic matter that is measured in soil that passes through a 2mm sieve. Organic matter (and the carbon it contains) that does not pass through a 2mm sieve is not sufficiently degraded to be considered as part of the SOM; they are either surface or buried organic residues.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">How are weeds managed on organic farms?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p  style="color:black;">Weed management on organic farms consists of cultural and mechanical techniques such as the rotation of crops that suppress weeds, mulching, tillage, cultivation, water management, and manual weeding. Weeds often help to conserve soil, improve organic matter, and provide beneficial habitat for natural enemies on organic farms. Plastic mulches are permitted provide they are removed at the end of the season. Insects and diseases can help to keep certain weed populations in check. There are a few natural substances that are also used to manage weeds, but the efficacy of these substances is still subject to question. </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">Must organic farmers use organic seeds?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p  style="color:black;">The NOP Rule requires that organically produced and handled seeds be planted when such seed is commercially available for the variety. Annual transplants must always be organically grown unless the Secretary of Agriculture in response to a natural disaster or other major interruption issues a temporary variance. All seed used in organic production must be untreated, or treated only with substances (such as microbial products) that are on the National List. Farmers are required to use certified organic seed when it is commercially available. Commercial availability is based on ability to obtain the seed in an appropriate form, quality, or quantity, as reviewed by the certification agent.  </p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">What is an e-Choupal ? How is it useful to farmers?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p style="color:black;"> An e-Choupal (External website that opens in a new window) is a service offered to farmers by ITC to help them work their way around market intermediaries and weak infrastructure. It is basically a computer with internet facility that allows users to access the e-Choupal website run by ITC. A local farmer acting as a coordinator or 'Sanchalak' runs this amenity. He receives a small commission from farmers who wish to use this facility. A local commission agent or 'Samyojak' assists the Sanchalak by providing logistical support.

Farmers use the computer to access daily closing prices of local mandis, international prices as well as details about new farming techniques. The computer at the e-Choupal may also be utilized for ordering seed, fertilizers and other products from ITC or its partners at discounted prices. During the harvest season, ITC proposes to buy the crop directly from farmers at the previous day's closing price. If the farmers agree, their crop is transported to an ITC processing centre, where it is weighed, assessed and paid for. Farmers who sell through e-Choupals usually receive a higher price for their produce than those who use the traditional mandi system.

Each e-Choupal costs between US$3,000 and US$6,000 to set up and around US$100 annually for maintenance. They usually serve an average of 600 farmers within a five km radius. Today, the e-Choupal network reaches more than 3.5 million farmers producing a range of commodities such as soybean, coffee, wheat, rice, pulses and shrimp. There are currently 5,200 e-Choupals in six States - Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan.</p>

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">What are the precautions to be taken while storing paddy?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p style="color:black;">Rice is stored in the form of paddy, rough rice, milled raw rice, milled boiled rice, bran and broken grain. These forms of rice may be stored on farms, mills or commercial warehouses depending on what it is needed for. Rice is usually packed into jute bags or in containers made of rope, straw or mud before being stored. Certain varieties of rice have to be stored for around a year before being consumed. Here are some rice storage tips:

    Rice may turn rancid due to heat, moisture or attacks by insects; therefore it is necessary to see that the warehouse is aerated and free of dampness. The target moisture level for storage of grains is less than 14 percent.
    Before storing grains, they should be properly dried.
    Storage rooms and gunny bags should be disinfected to make them rodent and bird free. Spray insecticides like Phostoxin to control small insects and place traps for rats. Rat and damp proof plinths are a useful storage resource.
    Inspect the grains regularly for signs of damage and infestation. Common rice pests are rice weevils, khapra beetles, rice moths and Angoumois grain moths.
    Cover the stock with tarpaulin and fumigants to get rid of insects.
    To avoid losses through storage, it is recommended that farmers use steel or cement bins or silos and underground storage structures.
    Cover stacks with specially fabricated polythene covers or phosphine fumigation covers.
    Bags of paddy should be placed on an elevated structure. They should not touch the floor or walls. This is done to prevent absorption of moisture and attacks by rats.

				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0" style="color:green; text-decoration:none">Where do I find the latest agricultural machinery?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p style="color:black;">Farm machines and equipment (External website that opens in a new window) play a pivotal role in crop production, harvesting, transportation, processing and preservation. In 1955, the government established the 'Agricultural Machinery Utilization Training Centre' at Budni, Madhya Pradesh to promote the use of machinery in agriculture. This centre was later renamed the 'Central Farm Machinery Training and Testing Institute (External website that opens in a new window)'.This institute is involved in testing the latest imported farm machinery and training farmers on their proper use, maintenance and up-keep.

This institute is involved in testing the latest imported farm machinery and training farmers on their proper use, maintenance and upkeep. This institute has acquired international standards in the field of farm machinery training and testing. It is equipped with demonstration-cum-training laboratories for tractors, engines, irrigation pumps, tractor hydraulics, tractor electrical, improved bullock drawn implements and the like. The institute also consists of a museum of tractors, farm machinery and equipment.</p>
